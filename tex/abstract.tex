\section*{Abstract}
	The $Z^0$ Boson is the neutral partner of the $W^{\pm}$ carrier particle of the weak interaction in the Standard Model. At CERN the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) collided electrons and positrons with center-of-mass energies around $91.2$ GeV, thereby resonantly creating the short-lived $Z^0$. In this protocol data collected by the "Omni-Purpose Apparatus for LEP" (OPAL) is analyzed to test fundamental features of the Standard Model and specifically of the electroweak interaction.\\
	By extracting the cross sections of several $Z^0$ decays for different center-of-mass energies and fitting the theoretically expected curve to this data, the Z0 mass and the total decay width were determined to be $M_Z=(91.188\pm0.008)$ GeV and $\Gamma_Z= (2.516\pm0.017)$ GeV.
	
	With those results the number of neutrino generations was then calculated to be $n_{\nu}=2.9\pm0.3$.
