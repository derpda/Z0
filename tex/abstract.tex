	The Z0 Boson is the neutral partner of the W^{\pm} carrier particle of the weak interaction in the Standard Model. At CERN the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) created it via e^{-}e^{+} Collisions at 91.2 GeV center-of-mass energy. In this protocol the data collected by the "Omni-Purpose Apparatus for LEP" (OPAL) is analyzed to test fundamental features of the Standard Model.\\
